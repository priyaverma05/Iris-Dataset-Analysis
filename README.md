# Iris Dataset Analysis ğŸŒ¿ğŸ“Š
This project focuses on analyzing the Iris dataset, a famous dataset in machine learning and statistics. The goal is to explore, visualize, and classify different Iris flower species using machine learning algorithms.

ğŸ”¹ Key Features:
## Dataset Loading & Preprocessing:

ğŸ”¹Uses Scikit-learn to load the Iris dataset

ğŸ”¹Converts numerical species labels into actual names

ğŸ”¹Splits data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

ğŸ”¹Displays dataset structure, summary statistics, and class distribution

ğŸ”¹Uses Seaborn pairplot to visualize feature relationships

## Feature Scaling:

ğŸ”¹Applies StandardScaler to normalize feature values for better model performance

## Machine Learning Model â€“ Random Forest Classifier:

ğŸ”¹Trains a Random Forest model (100 decision trees)

ğŸ”¹Predicts the species of test samples

ğŸ”¹Evaluates the model using accuracy score & classification report

## Performance Evaluation:

ğŸ”¹Accuracy Score: Measures how well the model performs

ğŸ”¹Classification Report: Provides precision, recall, and F1-score for each species
